Write your debugging steps and thought process here (This is part of your grade)

1. Search for any instance of creating a new object and delete it once the program has finished using it.
2. Clear out any pointers or arrays (also pointers in their own regaurd), to minimize memory usage.
3. Set pointers to null pointers.
4. After clearing out pointers created deconstructors.
5. Used the Memory Leak line to search through and find the rest of the errors and and step through the program.
